# Map Polyline Tool

This is an angular-based simple map annotation tool that generates a polyline or polygon by simply clicking on the map. Users can extract the lat long points of a 
polyline or polygon, remove your last point, change the style options or clear the whole thing by clicking on relevant buttons. To add a new point
to the map, just left-click on it.


### What is a Polyline?

A Polyline is a series of connected line segments which are useful to represent routes, paths, or other connections between locations on the map.


### What is a Polygon?

A Polygon is a shape consisting of a series of coordinates in an ordered sequence, similar to a Polyline. The difference is that polygon defines a closed area with 
a fillable interior, while a polyline is open-ended.
